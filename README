*** This is the README for fgh, the Fluxable GUI Helper.
FGH is designed to fill-in some of the gaps in and rough edges of accessibility in some window managers and light weight graphicl desktops. 
Even the most accessible graphicl environments may suffer from accessibility regressions, so this tool is designed to be as distro/desktop agnostic as 
practical. 
FGH also provides some information not available in panel applets and indicators as far as I know. 
While FGH is primarily designed to be used with keyboard shortcuts in a GUI it can be used in a pure CLI environment, i.e. from a shell prompt in a 
log-in tty.
Originally I was using several mini--scripts to give me information not presented accessily in fluxbox. I was getting requests for aditional 
mini-scripts, and I was considering adding some fuctionality to the ones I already had. This conbination of needs made it a no brainer to combine 
existing and proposed bits in to a single tool that would manage the retrieval  and display of a variety of information about both hard and software.
The sky is the limit, but the point of fgh is to access and present snippits, generally one or two lines, one or two data.
Fornow fgh is called with one option specifying what information is desired. Optionally a 2nd option can be combined to specify a display method to 
override the default.
The first option type uses letters to specify what is to be querried, and optionally the 2nd is a number that specifies the display mode.
Options do not take any arguments at this time.
